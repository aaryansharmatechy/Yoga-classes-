            <p>Yoga Bliss was founded with a simple goal — to create a calm, welcoming space
                where people can reconnect with their bodies, minds, and inner peace.
                We believe yoga is not about perfection, but about progress and presence.</p>
            <p>We focus on overall well-being by combining yoga postures, meditation, and relaxation techniques that
                reduce stress, improve flexibility, and promote inner peace.</p>
            <p>Our certified and experienced yoga instructors guide students with proper techniques, breathing
                practices, and mindful movements suitable for all levels—from beginners to advanced practitioners.</p>
            <p>Yoga Bliss is more than just a class—it’s a supportive community. We welcome people of all ages and
                fitness levels and encourage a positive, friendly, and inclusive environment.</p>
